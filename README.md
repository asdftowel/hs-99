# Solutions to 99 Haskell problems (WIP)
To see the problems themselves [https://wiki.haskell.org/index.php?title=99_Haskell_Problems](click here).
The files in the "solutions" folder are all named ProblemsX.hs,
where X is the number of the final problem of a group.

Some of them ended up being really similar or identical to
the solutions submitted to the wiki.

P.S. lists with an unbounded depth are really confusing.
