# Solutions to 99 Haskell problems (WIP)
To see the problems themselves, [click here](https://wiki.haskell.org/index.php?title=99_Haskell_Problems "H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems - HaskellWiki").
The files in the "solutions" folder are all named ProblemsX.hs,
where X is the number of the final problem in a group.

Some of them ended up being really similar or identical to
the solutions submitted to the wiki.
